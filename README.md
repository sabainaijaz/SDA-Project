# Functional and Data-Driven GDP Analysis 

## Description
We have designed and implemented a data-driven GDP analysis system using functional programming principles in Python, while enforcing the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and introducing configuration-based behavior.

# Getting Started
## Files: 
* loadData - Loading the CSV file and handling missing and invalid csv files
* processData - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and correcting data types. Filtering data based on specific region, specific year and specific country and performing statistical operations (average and sum) on this data.
* visualizeData - Generates region wise and year specific GDP plots 
* dashboard - Displays selected configuration values, computed statistical results and charts/diagrams.
